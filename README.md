car model recognition using cnn. and fitting the densenet121 model 

A basic CNN car model recognition done on the Cars Dataset found on Kaggle.
the model and the dataset is further fitted on Densenet121.
Plots of accuracy vs validation accuracy and loss vs validation loss are plotted on both CNN and Densenet models
A confusion matrix followed by a classification report is generated at the end.

Cars Dataset consists of two parts Test and Train
both of them consist of 7 different classes of cars
